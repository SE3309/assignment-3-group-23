The CSV Files were initially created using the Fabricate online tool.
The tool did not properly account for foreign keys and the dates were in the wrong format.
The CSV files outputted by the tool were then manually adjusted using relatively advanced formulas in excel.
The CSV files in this folder are the final files, after the excel corrections.
